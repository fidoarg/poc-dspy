How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Then, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number of shooting stars observed.\n",
